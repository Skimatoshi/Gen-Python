# An object is a container for variables and functions

# Variables | Health , Energy, Stamina, Damage 
# Functions | Attack, Movement, Animations

Special names only for OOP
# Variables - > Attributes
# Functions - > Methods


# A class is the blueprint for an object

- Classes precedes objects
- A class also accepts arguments to customise the object

Why use classes and objects?
1. They organise complex code
2. They help to create reusable code
3. They are used everywhere
4. Some modules require you to create classes
5. They make it easier to work with scope

# A dunder method is a method that is not called by the user
 - Instead is is called by python when something happens
